# CMSGTechnicalRestaurantDeliveryPlatform
The project simulates a restaurant e-commerce / delivery platform, with a focus on the menu and basket experience. It assumes the user is already authenticated and that menu data is supplied from a backend service containing only items the user is authorised to view or modify.
